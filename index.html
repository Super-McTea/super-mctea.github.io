                        Hi, my name is Super McTea.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Well I suppose that's not technically my "real" name, but it <em>is</em> how I'm known on the internet, and the name that I publish all my projects under. So for all intents and purposes, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will likely know me best from my work with <strong>L Stands for Winner</strong>, as I have made many games together with them over the years as a developer and as the team's composer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of game development as a whole, I typically enjoy spending my time with hobbies that can serve as learning opportunities, creative outlets, or both. Recently I have been experimenting with new tech in Virtual Reality for example, but some of my other hobbies include playing the piano, composing music tracks in various genres, sketching and drawing, as well as live-streaming. I tend to post my drawings on X (formerly Twitter), post my music on YouTube, my games on itch.io, and live-stream on Twitch.
                    </p>
